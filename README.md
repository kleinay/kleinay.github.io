# Ayal Klein

Hi, welcome to my homepage.

## About 

I am a Ph.D researcher in Computer Science in the [Natural Language Processing Lab](https://biu-nlp.github.io/) at [Bar Ilan University](http://www1.biu.ac.il/indexE.php) under the supervision of [Prof. Ido Dagan](http://www.cs.biu.ac.il/~dagan/). 
Most of my research so far is focused on Semantic Representations. Other that that, my research interests are broad and include computational linguistics, semantics and meaning, cognitive psycholinguistics and applied deep learning for NLP.   

I completed my B.Sc. (2015) in Psychology and Philosophy and my M.Sc. (2018) in Computer Science at Bar Ilan University.  

## The QASem project

We have devised a natural way to break down the information conveyed by langauge, using question-answer pairs. Our semantic framework, termed *QASem* (QA-based Semantics), consists of several annotation 'layers' covering different types of textual information or *semantic relations*. Our tool takes in a sentences and outputs a set of QAs that correspond to the basic information units in the sentence. You can take a look at the [QASem demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/kleinay/qasem-demo) or install it in your python environment through `pip install qasem`. See our [repo](https://github.com/kleinay/QASem) for further details.

## Teaching Experience

This year (2023) I will be lecturing the “Artificial Neural Networks” course at the neuroscience department, Bar Ilan University.

Previously, I had a great time teaching in the following courses:

* Teacher Assistant for “Object Oriented Programming” Course (89-111), Bar Ilan University (2019-2020).

* Teacher Assistant for “Discrete Mathematics 1” Course (89-195), Bar Ilan University (2019).

* Teacher Assistant for “Text Understanding” Course (89-565), Bar Ilan University (2018).
