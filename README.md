Hi, welcome to my homepage.

## About 


I am a post-doctoral researcher in Queen Mary University of London and Bar Ilan University, working on Natual Language Processing. I work with Prof. Maria Liakata and Prof. Dana Atzil-Slonim on employing advanced NLP methods in order to gain scientific insights in the domain of psychotherapy research. Our goal is to decipher the mental processes and dynamics underlying mental health and effective psychotherapy.   

Previously, I completed my B.Sc. (2015) in Psychology and Philosophy at [Bar Ilan University](http://www1.biu.ac.il/indexE.php), and my M.Sc. (2018) and Ph.D. (2024) in Computer Science, in the [Natural Language Processing Lab](https://biu-nlp.github.io/) at Bar Ilan University under the supervision of [Prof. Ido Dagan](http://www.cs.biu.ac.il/~dagan/). My Ph.D was focused on Semantic Representations (see [the QASem project](#the-qasem-project)).  

Beyond that, my research interests are (very) broad, and include computational linguistics, semantics and meaning, cognitive psycholinguistics, and understanding NLP deep learning models. 
I'm also enthusiastic about cross-disciplanry collaborations of AI and Data-Science specialists with social sciences and humanities, aiming at revolutionzing the way we investigate, measure and confirm/disprove scientific research questions in the ``softer'' sciences.    

## The QASem project

In my Ph.D, we have devised a natural way to break down the information conveyed by langauge, using question-answer pairs. Our semantic framework, termed *QASem* (QA-based Semantics), consists of several annotation 'layers' covering different types of textual information or *semantic relations*. Our tool takes in a sentences and outputs a set of QAs that correspond to the basic information units in the sentence. You can take a look at the [QASem demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/kleinay/qasem-demo) or install its latest version it in your python environment through `pip install qasem_parser`. See our [repo](https://github.com/kleinay/QASem) for further details (or Paul's [repo](https://github.com/plroit/qasem_parser) for the latest, more performant version).
