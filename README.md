Hi, welcome to my homepage.

## About 

I am a Ph.D researcher in Computer Science in the [Natural Language Processing Lab](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~nlp/) at [Bar Ilan University](http://www1.biu.ac.il/indexE.php) under the supervision of [Prof. Ido Dagan](http://www.cs.biu.ac.il/~dagan/). 
Most of my research so far is focused on Semantic Representations, and we are working on devising a natural way to break down the information conveyed by langauge. 
My research interests are broad and include computational linguistics, semantics and meaning, cognitive psycholinguistics and applied deep learning for NLP.   

I completed my B.Sc. (2015) in Psychology and Philosophy and my M.Sc. (2018) in Computer Science at Bar Ilan University.
